Data Exploration, Preparation and Visualization using SQL, Tableau and Power BI  

This repository displays the most recent data analysis projects I conducted using SQL, Tableu and Power BI  

**Covid-19 Dashboard**  

Dataset source:

For creating a dashboard that displays the Covid global numbers (as of 30th April 2021) including forecasting projections based on trends for some countries such as the US, Brazil, Ireland and India.  
I cleaned and prepared the data using SQL (the code can be found in the file named "Covid ProjectPortfolio SQL script.sql") in the link --> https://github.com/lemarigo/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Covid%20ProjectPortfolio%20SQL%20script.sql  

The dashboard is saved as a pdf ("Tableau - Covid Dashboard.pdf") and it can also be visualized in my Tableau profile in the following link --> https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/leandro.marigo/viz/CovidDashboard_16866832289280/Dashboard1
