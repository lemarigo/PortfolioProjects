**Covid-19 - Tableau Dashboard**  

Dataset source:

The dashboard displays the Covid global numbers (as of 30th April 2021) including forecasting projections based on trends for some countries such as the US, Brazil, Ireland and India.  

For creating the dashboard I cleaned and prepared the data using SQL (the code can be found in the file named "Covid ProjectPortfolio SQL script.sql") or in the following link --> https://github.com/lemarigo/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Covid%20ProjectPortfolio%20SQL%20script.sql  

The Tableau dashboard is saved in this repository as a pdf document ("Tableau - Covid Dashboard.pdf") and it can also be visualized in my Tableau profile in the following link --> https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/leandro.marigo/viz/CovidDashboard_16866832289280/Dashboard1

**Global cost of living - Power BI Dashboard**  

Dataset source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mvieira101/global-cost-of-living  

The dashboard identifies which countries accross the Globe has the highest/lowest income and cost of living based on the McMeal average cost in US dollars, making it easy to set filters and explore what countries have their income and cost of living aligned and which countries are impacted by the high cost of living.  

For creating the dashboard I used Excel and Power BI to clean and prepare the data.
The step by step can be found in the pdf document named "Cost of Living dataset - Data Cleaning and Transformation using Excel and Power BI.pdf" or in the link --> https://github.com/lemarigo/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Cost%20of%20Living%20dataset%20-%20Data%20Cleaning%20and%20Transformation%20using%20Excel%20and%20Power%20BI.pdf
